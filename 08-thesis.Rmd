# Your thesis {-#thesis}

Below you will find descriptive text and links to some orientation videos to provide more context for the key requirements new students need to think about in their first year. These videos are intended for you as a reference, but if you want more clarification or have other questions be sure to ask. Click on the videos below or find them in the `\\FRST-IRSStor\Root\ByProject\Orientation\Orientation_Videos` folder.

## Writing your proposal & setting up a committee {-#thesiswriting}

Within the first few months of starting your degree you’ll need to write a mini proposal, which will be sent to potential committee members. The mini proposal will then be enhanced into a full proposal after getting feedback from your committee during your first committee meeting.

* Check out some Nicholas’ Proposal Tips powerpoint presentation in `//ByProject//Orientation` to familiarize yourself with the components and expectations

* Check out `//ByProject//Orientation` for example proposals and committee meeting presentation

### Developing a mini proposal {-#proposal}

</p>

* Likely first comments back from Nicholas about your writing, and they may come across quite strongly (perhaps even brash) - don’t take it personally, this is a learning curve for most new grad students and Nicholas just tries to be clear and concise

* After your mini-proposal is sent to your committee you will need to have your first committee meeting

### Establishing and preparing for your first committee meeting {-#committee}

### Thoughts around TAing {-#TAing}
In addition to working on their thesis, some students also decide to become teaching assistants for undergraduate and graduate classes. her are some things to consider about TA'ing.

## Thesis structure {-#thesisstructure}

Your thesis is the most important document that you will produce in your time in the lab. Below you will find the general structure and main components of the thesis, as well as links to the graduate studies website and previous theses.

## Completion timeline {-#completion}

MSc students typically get two years of funding; the goal is to complete your degree in that time, but this is not a ‘hard’ rule. Around the two year mark, Nicholas will have a conversation about when you are going to finish. If it takes you an extra month or two Nicholas will continue paying your stipend, given you have shown consistent efforts to finish. PhD students get four years of funding. The goal is to complete your comprehensive exam before you finish your second year, and defend in your fourth year. Again, Nicholas will likely have a conversation with you when you get close to the fourth year mark.

## Publishing {-#publishing}

Nicholas encourages you to write academic papers about the components of your thesis project - these will basically become your thesis chapters (& parts of other sections). The goal is 2 for MSc and 4 for PhD. 

More often than not students defend before they have published their 2nd or 4th paper. Nicholas addresses writing papers in the mini-proposal and mini-to-full proposal videos.

## Conferences {-#conferences}

Nicholas typically funds 1 conference for MSc students and 2 conferences for PhD students. Examples include:

* [Canadian Remote Sensing Symposium - vast topics in remote sensing research across Canada (located in various cities across Canada)](https://crss-sct.ca/) 

* [ForestSAT - spatial analysis and remote sensing technologies for forest monitoring, modeling & description (international)](https://forestsat2020.forestsat.com/)

* [Silvilaser - LiDAR focused (international)](https://silvilaser2021.at/)

* [WHISPERS - Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (international)](https://www.ieee-whispers.com/)

These conferences are a great opporunity to meet other scientists in your field, learn about their work, present your own, and make opportunities for collaboration.
