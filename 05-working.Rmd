# Working in the lab or from home {-#working}

Prior to COVID-19, students were encouraged to be active members by coming into UBC each day. Students should limit spending large amounts of time working from home. With the advent of COVID and working from home we have seen the implications of not being around a dynamic and in-person lab, and as a result post COVID we intend to return to that requirement that all students come to UBC each day. We do appreciate however that each of you have different working styles with some students wishing to arrive early and leave early others may choose to arrive late and work late. That is fine with me and generally we could consider the hours between 10 - 2pm as being critical hours that everyone is around.

With respect to taking days off during the week we appreciate that you may wish to take a day off occasionally during the week to reward yourself for a job well done or simply to enjoy outdoor activities without the rush of the weekend. You are welcome to do so as long as you recognize generally that that time would need to be made up, either through working on a weekend or extra hours during the week. For example, members of the lab have been known to take long weekends during the winter for skiing where they then make up the time lost by working a day on the following weekend.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%",fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="The western lab room."}

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%",fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="The eastern lab room."}
knitr::include_graphics("img\\lab4.jpg")
