# Computer related information {-#computers}

Your workstation is a state-of-the-art, powerful, server-grade computer, with two processors, 16 to 24 cores, 64GB of RAM, and a professional graphics card for accelerating 3D computations. It will come with some software pre-installed (e.g. MS Office), however, based on your project you may request additional software to be installed.

## Software {-#software}

UBC has license for the following software packages:

* ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro

* Envi+IDL

* eCognition

* Adobe suite, including Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign etc.


You can also install some software packages yourself, as long as they are free or the license is available. Some of the most useful software packages we use in the lab currently include:

* [R + RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)

* [LAStools (point cloud data processing, license available)](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/)

* [CloudCompare (for viewing ALS/DAP point clouds))](https://www.danielgm.net/cc/)

* [SnagIt - Navigate to teaching and learning software](https://it.ubc.ca/software-downloads)

* [Camtasia - Navigate to teaching and learning software](https://it.ubc.ca/software-downloads)

### IT questions or contact needs {-#it}

If you have some questions about your computer reach out to Nicholas first. The IRSS has a dedicated departmental IT person named Felix Choi. If you need things installed or have hardware questions email him at `felix.choi@ubc.ca`.

## Your laptop {-#laptop}

You will receive a laptop that is for your personal use throughout the length of your graduate studies. Please remember that similar to workstations, laptops are also tracked by UBC. If you are unsure about installing a program, please make sure to ask Nicholas before installation. The same responsibilities apply to use of your laptop as the workstation.

```

If you are a TA and using the laptop for grading or have any TA material on there, it **MUST** be encrypted, which is performed by your IT contact. If your laptop was set up by UBC It, it is automatically encrypted.

## Backing up your files {-#backup}

It is crucial that you install and set up a data backup software on your computer(s). There has been numerous hard drive failures in the lab before, and you should **always** be prepared that the hard drive in your computer can stop working at any moment. 

Nicholas will pay for [SYNC (4TB)](https://www.sync.com/) if desired and provide a portable hard drive for local backups. 

To automate backups you can use software like [Cobian Backup](https://www.cobiansoft.com/). Schedule your backups to be incremental and run them daily. 

## Setting up a shared drive {-#shared}

IRSS has access to a file server, which is divided into two main folders.

### ByProject & ByUser {-#pcshared}

ByProject contains datasets related to research projects; ByUser is a space for each lab member to share data with others. These two folders can be accessed from any computer in the lab and should be mapped for easier access.

It's important that you **do not use IRSS shared drives as your file backup folder** as storage space on these drives is limited.

To map these drives to your machine do the following:

1. `Open File Explorer > right-click on ‘This PC’ (found in left side list) > click ‘map network drive’`
2. Choose a letter (e.g. “Z”) and paste the following `\\FRST-IRSStor\Root\ByProject`

3. Repeat this process and assign a different letter (e.g. “Y”) to the second network folder: `\\FRST-IRSStor\Root\ByUser`

## Connecting from home {-#rdp}

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%",fig.align = 'center',fig.cap="Remote desktop prompt window."}

```

In the lab we can use the Windows Remote Desktop Connection tool to connect to our machines when we are away from the lab. In order to connect to the your lab machine, there are a few steps that need to be followed.

1. Connect to a VPN. On your work laptop, you should have Cisco Anyconnect installed, but it can also be downloaded from http://myvpn.ubc.ca/. To log in, use your CWL.

2. Open the Remote Desktop Connection and enter your computer's name as follows: `frst-frm-22XYZ.ead.ubc.ca`, where `XYZ` are the digits/letter unique to your desktop (There will be a sticker on the top of your computer tower with these details).

3. Click connect. You will be prompted to enter your CWL again. Alternatively, you can run the following command: `mstsc /v frst-frm-22XYZ.ead.ubc.ca`, and enter your CWL when promoted.

You have now successfully remoted in! 

Note: it is possible edit the display settings to stretch over 2 screens if you wish. You can also use the minimize button if you are also working on your laptop at the same time, this will not end your remote session.

## Connecting to printers {-#print}

The IRSS has both a black and white and colour printer available for use. In order to gain access to them follow these steps:

1. Open `Control Panel` then go under `Devices and Printers` and click `Add a printer`.

2. Click `The printer that I want isn't listed`.

3. Select `Add a printer using TCP/IP address of hostname` then click `Next`.

4. Insert IP address of the printer (see IPs below). Append the `Port name` as shown then click `Next`.

5. If a window appears that asks about driver version select `Use the driver that is currently installed`.

6. Keep the default printer name then click `Next`.

7. Make sure `Do not share this printer` is selected then click `Next`.

You should now be connected!
