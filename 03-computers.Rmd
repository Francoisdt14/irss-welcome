# Computer related information {-#pc}

Your workstation is a state-of-the-art, powerful, server-grade computer, with two processors, 16 to 24 cores, 64GB of RAM, and a professional graphics card for accelerating 3D computations. It will come with some software pre-installed (e.g. MS Office), however, based on your project you may request additional software to be installed.

## Software {-#software}

UBC has license for the following software packages:

* ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro

* Envi+IDL

* eCognition

* Adobe suite, including Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign etc.


You can also install some software packages yourself, as long as they are free or the license is available. Some of the most useful software packages we use in the lab currently include:

* [R + RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)

* [LAStools (point cloud data processing, license available)](https://rapidlasso.com/lastools/)

* [CloudCompare (for viewing ALS/DAP point clouds))](https://www.danielgm.net/cc/)

* [SnagIt - “ Naigate to Teaching and Learning Software”](https://it.ubc.ca/software-downloads)

* [Camtasia - https://it.ubc.ca/software-downloads - “Teaching and Learning Software”](https://it.ubc.ca/software-downloads)


### IT questions or contact needs {-#it}

If you have some questions about your computer reach out to Nicholas first. The IRSS has a dedicated departmental IT person named Felix Choi. If you need things installed or have hardware questions email him at `felix.choi@ubc.ca`.

## Your Laptop {-#laptop}

You will receive a laptop that is for your personal use throughout the length of your graduate studies. Please remember that similar to workstations, laptops are also tracked by UBC. If you are unsure about installing a program, please make sure to ask Nicholas before installation. The same responsibilities apply to use of your laptop as the workstation.

If you are a TA and using the laptop for grading or have any TA material on there, it **MUST** be encrypted, which is performed by your IT contact. If your laptop was set up by UBC It, it is automatically encrypted.

## Backing up your files {-#backup}

It is crucial that you install and set up a data backup software on your computer(s). There has been numerous hard drive failures in the lab before, and you should **always** be prepared that the hard drive in your computer can stop working at any moment. 

Nicholas will pay for [SYNC (4TB)](https://www.sync.com/) if desired and provide a portable hard drive for local backups. 

To automate backups you can use software like [Cobian Backup](https://www.cobiansoft.com/). Schedule your backups to be incremental and run them daily. 

## Setting up a shared drive {-#shared}

IRSS has access to a file server, which is divided into two main folders.

### ByProject & ByUser {-#pcshared}

ByProject contains datasets related to research projects; ByUser is a space for each lab member to share data with others. These two folders can be accessed from any computer in the lab and should be mapped for easier access.

It's important that you **do not use IRSS shared drives as your file backup folder** as storage space on these drives is limited.

To map these drives to your machine do the following:

1. `Open File Explorer > right-click on ‘This PC’ (found in left side list) > click ‘map network drive’`
2. Choose a letter (e.g. “Z”) and paste the following `\\FRST-IRSStor\Root\ByProject`

3. Repeat this process and assign a different letter (e.g. “Y”) to the second network folder: `\\FRST-IRSStor\Root\ByUser`
