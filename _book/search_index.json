These videos are intended for you as a reference, but if you want more clarification or have other questions be sure to ask. Click on the videos below or find them in the \\\\FRST-IRSStor\\Root\\ByProject\\Orientation\\Orientation_Videos folder. Other helpful resources on writing can be found at \\\\FRST-IRSStor\\Root\\ByProject\\__LABFORMS\\Scientific writing. Important resources for writing your thesis Within the first few months of starting your degree, youll need to write a mini proposal, which will be sent to potential committee members. The mini proposal will then be enhanced into a full proposal after getting feedback from your committee during your first committee meeting. Developing a mini proposal Youll likely get the first comments back about your writing from Nicholas. They may come across quite strongly (perhaps even brash) - dont take it personally, this is a learning curve for most new grad students, and Nicholas just tries to be clear and concise. After your mini-proposal is sent to your committee, you will need to have your first committee meeting. Establishing and preparing for your first committee meeting Nicholas will help you to find potential committee members. Committee meetings happen once per year, with your first meeting ideally 6 months after you start. Committee meeting forms can be found in \\\\FRST-IRSStor\\Root\\ByProject\\__LABFORMS\\Ctee-Mtg-Forms. Adaptation of the mini proposal to a full proposal after that first committee meeting Use feedback from your first committee meeting. Every section will become more detailed and expanded. From 8  20 for MSc; 30 for PhD. Update your timeline and plans based on progress to date. Text is used in the development of the bookends in the final thesis. Writing a literature review Getting published in peer reviewed literature Part 1: Part 2: Details about the publication process including: Thoughts to consider before starting to write How to write effective science Things to know about the publication process The importance of peer-review Thoughts around TAing In addition to working on their thesis, some students also decide to become teaching assistants for undergraduate and graduate classes. Here are some things to consider about TAing. TAing looks great on your resume and can help to expose you to new ideas and learn different software. TAing does not replace research, it is done in addition to your research. The last 3 months of your program The last few months of your program can be hectic. A lot of things can be happening at once, so its important to know what to expect! Getting ready to defend your thesis. Timetable and considerations during your last months prior to defense. Transforming papers to a submitted thesis. Committee feedback and selecting examiners. These videos and other resources can be found in \\\\FRST-IRSStor\\Root\\ByProject\\Orientation. Check it out to familiarize yourself with the components and expectations of your thesis, as well as example proposals and committee meeting presentations. Thesis structure Your thesis is the most important document that you will produce in your time in the lab. Below you will find the general structure and main components of the thesis, as well as links to the graduate studies website and previous theses. Section Specifics Administrative Title Page Certification Page Abstract Lay Summary Preface Table of Contents List of Tables List of Figures List of Abbreviations Acknowledgements Dedication Chapter 1 Introduction - based on proposal &amp; parts of introduction of your papers Chapter 2 Study area (and in some cases also Data if consistent across chapters) Chapter 3 &amp; 4 (also 5 &amp; 6 for PhD) Methods (for each question/paper) Results (for each question/paper) Discussion (for each question/paper) Chapter 5 (7 for PhD) Conclusion - big picture parts taken from the discussion of your papers Overview addressing main research goals Significance of research and key findings Implications Limitations Future work Nitty gritty details from UBC Graduate Studies. Search previous students theses here Completion timeline Funding availability is the primary driver of your completion timeline. This can vary from student to student so its important to talk with Nicholas about your funding situation. MSc students typically get two years of funding; the goal is to complete your degree in that time, but this is not a hard rule. Around the two year mark, Nicholas will have a conversation about when you are going to finish. If it takes you an extra month or two Nicholas will continue paying your stipend, given you have shown consistent efforts to finish. PhD students get four years of funding. The goal is to complete your comprehensive exam before you finish your second year, and defend in your fourth year. Again, Nicholas will likely have a conversation with you when you get close to the fourth year mark. Figure 1: Agatha immediately after her recent successful defence. Congrats, Agatha! Publishing Nicholas encourages you to write academic papers about the components of your thesis project - these will basically become your thesis chapters (&amp; parts of other sections). The goal is 2 for MSc and 4 for PhD. More often than not students defend before they have published their 2nd or 4th paper. Nicholas addresses writing papers in the mini-proposal and mini-to-full proposal videos. Conferences Nicholas typically funds 1 conference for MSc students and 2 conferences for PhD students. Examples include: Canadian Remote Sensing Symposium - vast topics in remote sensing research across Canada (located in various cities across Canada) ForestSAT - spatial analysis and remote sensing technologies for forest monitoring, modeling &amp; description (international) Silvilaser - LiDAR focused (international) WHISPERS - Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (international) These conferences are a great opporunity to meet other scientists in your field, learn about their work, present your own, and make opportunities for collaboration. Figure 2: Francois speaking at Silvilaser 2019 in Foz de Iguazu. Figure 3: Annie speaking about her work at the Remote Sensing for Forest Practitioners workshop in Edmonton.
