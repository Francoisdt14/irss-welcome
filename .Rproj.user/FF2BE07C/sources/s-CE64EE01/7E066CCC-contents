# Communication & staying in touch {-#comms}

There are two main forms of communication in the lab: **Slack** and **email**. 


## Slack {-#slack}
[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/) is a popular messaging platform. When you become a lab member you’ll receive an invitation to the IRSS Slack channel. Follow-up with Nicholas if you haven’t yet.

The IRSS slack portal ID is `ubc-irss.slack.com`

IRSS Slack contains several channels, each serving different purposes. The most important channels are:

* **#general** - For general discussion on various topics.

* **#ncc_annouce** - For important announcements, typically only Nicholas will post in this channel.

* **#science** - Anything science related, can be an interesting paper or a coding issue someone is struggling with.

* **#irss-supp-grp** - Lab support group. A place to _anonymously_ share ideas of how to improve the lab, talk about issues not related to your research, or ask for help. Important to note that Nicholas is not a member of this channel. 

You’ll quickly notice that the conversations on slack (especially on #general) are often very relaxed. However, remember that all public channels are PG13.

## Email {-#email}

Nicholas's primary email is `nicholas.coops@ubc.ca`. He generally tries to respond to emails as quickly as possible, but if he hasn’t replied to you in 2 days, send him a reminder. He emails can often be short and direct, he sends alot of them daily!
